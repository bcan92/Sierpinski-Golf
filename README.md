Sierpinski-Golf
===============

Sierpinski triangle algorithm code, influenced by the code golf attempts made with Perl.
C# doesn't quite get there, but it was a fun attempt nevertheless.
Run it from command line after compilation as:
fractal_golf.exe <depth>
If running full-screen on cygwin terminal, it's possible to achieve depth of 9 without distorting the output!
